# ProteinPeptideDocking
## Source codes for protein-peptide docking

After downloading the files, please follow these steps to run the codes:

  **1**- Extract the .zip file
  <br/><br/><br/>
  **2**- From the poses folder, copy the dataset into the main directory containing the algorithms codes and, then, extract it
  <br/><br/><br/>
  **3**- For runnning the algorithms, you need to one of the python programming language's versions such as "python 3.1" or higher versions
  <br/><br/><br/>
  **4**- Please check that the numpy module has been installed and exist for python. If not, you can install the module using the following command in CMD:
  
      pip install numpy
  <br/><br/><br/>   
  **5**- Open the algorithm.py file, determine the input file and the algorithm, like the following figure

  <br/><br/><br/>
  **6**- Press **F5** to run the source code
  <br/><br/><br/>
  **7**- During the execution, the electrostaic, van der waals, solvation, and hydrogen bond energies are appeared in the python shell for every iteration of the algorithm's steps (please the following figure)

  <br/><br/><br/>
  **8**- To determine the 3D predicted poses of the given peptide's atoms, go to the poses folder. A .txt file has been created for the chosen peptide. After opening it, go to the end of file and observe the latest predicted poses (please the following figure)

  <br/><br/><br/>
  **9**- To further parameter regulation, refer to the algorithms file (e.g., Trader.py) and change the noc and noi parameters, as shown in the following figure
